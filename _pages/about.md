Hi! I am Anugya Srivastava, a recent graduate with a Masters in Computer Science from the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, NYU, where I primarily focused on honing my skills in developing intelligent information systems. I am currently working as a Data Scientist at PRIISM, the Center for Practice and Research at the Intersection of Information, Society, and Methodology. I am working with [Prof. Jennifer Hill's](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/people/jennifer-hill) Causal Inference group and focusing on a study of the usability of web-based analysis tools.

In one of the summers during grad school, I had the opportunity to intern at Amazon for Summer'22 and was offered to join the team in a full time capacity post my Masters. Prior to graduate school, I have worked at a couple of startups across the globe - Switzerland, India and USA - where I was responsible for building deep learning pipelines for high dimensional data, for use cases ranging from efficient annotation generation to activity detection and 3D reconstruction.
